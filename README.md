# Encryption-Library

This is a simple message encryption library written in C. This library uses stdio.h, stdlib.h, and string.h. This library provides two functions an encode function and a decode function.
Encode takes two argutments first the message then the key (0 or 1), Decode takes the encoded message and the key and decodes it.

# Limitations and Future features

The the message can only be up one thousand characters long, and their are only two seperate keys at the present. I intend to add more encryption keys and methods to increase the complexity and usefulness of this library enclosed in this repository is an example program that uses this library. This library is one of my first projects as a computer programer and I am eager to imporve it!
